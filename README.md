   The internet of things field knows an exponential growth and the application are numerous, especially in public health-care. The development of high sensitivity and accuracy sensors are a huge interest for gas pollution detection. This sensor was developed using the INSA Toulouse AIME (Atelier Interuniversitaire de Micro-nano Electronique) facilities and based on the Jeremie Grisoliaâ€™s work. It is composed of silicon rods and WO3 nanoparticles sensitive to gas and a heating resistor.<br>

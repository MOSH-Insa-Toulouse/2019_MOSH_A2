## 1.Sensor
   The internet of things field knows an exponential growth and the application are numerous, especially in public health-care. The development of high sensitivity and accuracy sensors are a huge interest for gas pollution detection. This sensor was developed using the INSA Toulouse AIME (Atelier Interuniversitaire de Micro-nano Electronique) facilities and based on the Jeremie Grisoliaâ€™s work. It is composed of silicon rods and WO3 nanoparticles sensitive to gas and a heating resistor.<br>

   <br>Here is the data we get of the features of our sensor

## 2.Arduino
   Below we will introduce the ardunio part. We have established a gas detection program through our gas sensor. By setting a threshold value, if the detected value exceeds this threshold value, the red led will light up and the alarm will be remembered. I want the user to send a reminder that the detection value exceeds the limit. Only when we press the button does it mean that we know the warning, and the buzzer sound will turn off.<br>

   <br>
   Then we send data through the lora module through the library of the Internet of Things.By Viewing the device in the account to establish the transmission.<br>

   <br>
   If it is normally we get 0 and sned 1 if the threshold is exceeded, our functions are well implemented, but we are sorry that we did not take photos because there were not enough lora modules at the time. , But you can put lora into the corresponding io port and run the program according to the code

### Schematic

This shield is composed of:

    a LoRa Module (RN2483) as transceiver
    a Gas sensor
    an amplifier (LTC1050)
    a buzzer warning users depending on gas sensor value

First, we created the project with an arduino UNO

Then, we created a library symbol for LTC 1050 and RN2483 Breakout

Afterwards, we created the following circuit decomposed in 3 parts : 
<br>
1. Arduino part :<br>

3. Buzzer part :

### PCB

We first created all the footrpints needed. According the fact we needed to do the routage mostly on one layer (green). The red layer correspond to jumper added after PCB printing.

Finally, this what we got in 2D without ground :

And with ground :
